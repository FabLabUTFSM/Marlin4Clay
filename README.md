# Marlin4Clay

Marlin4Clay is an I2C enabled Marlin version for Clay 3D printing users. 

The idea is to give the user the posibility to manage the extruders feeder key parameters through the Slicer, and send them from the RAMPS board to an Arduino Uno with a BioFeeder Shield I have developed. 

The firmware to manage the feeders and comunicates with the RAMPS Board will also be shared here.
